# Heart-Disease-Prediction - Research Paper Project
Research Paper Project, AI, ML, Pandas, NumPy, SkLearn

This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of heart disease in patients based on various health-related features. The model uses a dataset of health metrics to determine the probability of a patient having heart disease. This project was part of a research paper where we explored **machine learning** techniques to predict health conditions.

## Features
- **Heart Disease Prediction**: Uses various health indicators to predict whether a patient has heart disease.
- **Machine Learning**: Implemented using **scikit-learn** (sklearn) for classification tasks.
- **Dataset**: The dataset includes patient data such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, etc.
  
## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Machine Learning Library**: scikit-learn (sklearn)
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Data Handling**: CSV format for the dataset
- **Version Control**: GitHub

## Project Setup
1. Open Code in Google Colab.
2. Upload CSV dataset to it and run.

## What I Worked On
Data Handling: Helped with organizing and formatting the dataset for the project.
Model Training: Observed and assisted in using scikit-learn for basic classification tasks.
Evaluation: Learned how model performance is checked using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
Research Contribution: Helped in writing the paper by discussing observations and documenting results.

## Learning Areas
Got a basic introduction to machine learning through this project.
Although I donâ€™t fully understand AI/ML yet, I got to observe how models like Logistic Regression and Decision Trees are used in practice.
Contributed to data preparation and research writing, while beginning to explore libraries like scikit-learn.
